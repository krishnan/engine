 * FileComment: <text> The RAR file type is primarily associated with 'WinRAR'
    by RarLab. Spanned archives can come in two forms: the original .R00 to .R99
    or the new PART#.RAR form. Some programs use the RAR format for their data 
    files as well. As a bit of trivia: RAR was created by Eugene Roshal 
    (RAR= Roshal ARchive).
